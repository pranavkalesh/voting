Here is the comprehensive plan for executing the task of updating the application name:

### Plan:

1. **Update Navbar Component**:
   - Change the application name from "VoteVice" to the new name in `src/components/Navbar.jsx`.

2. **Update Home Component**:
   - Modify the welcome message in `src/components/Home.jsx` to reflect the new application name.

3. **Update Dashboard Component**:
   - Update the welcome message in `src/components/Dashboard.jsx` to include the new application name for consistency.

4. **Check App Component**:
   - Review `src/App.jsx` to ensure that any branding or title related to the application name is updated if necessary.

### Follow-up Steps:
- After making these changes, I will test the application to ensure that the new name is displayed correctly across all components.
